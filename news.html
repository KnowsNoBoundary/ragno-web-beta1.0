                    I will practice my CSS to make this website much prettier. So, I won't be updating the website too often, because I will be learning new techniques. Plus, I need to process the information, to become a better developer on front-end.
                </p>
                June 11 - June 17
                <p>
                    Will continue to try new CSS challenges and hopefully touch upon JS (Javascript) for back-end development.
                </p>
                June 18 - June 24
                <p>
                    Expect me to be absent quite a lot, because I will be preparing myself to go back to college again. Lots of paperwork that needs to be done, and talking. Regardless, I will do my best to do my weekly quota in UNITE, and keep improving my CSS and JS skills.
                </p>
                June 25 - June 30
                <p>
                    I don't know what to expect for this week, but I will update it, if anything comes to mind.

                This area will be ideas I have for this website. It's a checklist for me, and anyone who is interested on what to see in the future.
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a simple calander for this website</li>
                    <li>The word RAGNO will be animated in the HOME page</li>
                    <li>Change the turtwig pictures for discord profile pictures. Meaning, whatever you have as your profile picture in discord will be in the website. (NOTE: this thing will be manually change since I don't know how to use an API yet. Therefore it will be a weekly thing)</li>
                    <li>Fix visual errors for phone</li>
